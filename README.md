# The Chore Wheel

## Overview
Do you ever look around your house and say, "Boy, this house is a pig stye!" And then promptly sit down on your couch for the rest of the day watching television, crippled with sensory overload at the sheer amount of things you need to accomplish? Me, too! Always. Like even right now. You're in luck, though! Because I have a solution for you. It's called...

### THE CHORE WHEEL!!!!!

Aren't you just so excited? Well, you should be. THIS chore wheel will be different from every other chore wheel you've ever encountered. Because this one will be fun! You access the website (logging in is optional!) and spin the wheel (a la Trivia Crack or Wheel of Fortune!). As the colors / options spin, you wait with anticipation as it lands on the chore you should do today, effectively curing your procrastination tendencies by choosing the unpleasant thing you need to do for you, thus saving you hours of time deciding what to work on!

But wait, there's more! You can also create an account and log in to keep track of what chores you've done and when chores need to be done again. Each category will have a way for you to add new things to them that are specific to your own house and a frequency of how often those things should be done. Each time you spin the wheel while logged in, it'll have the list of things that needs to get done in that specific category to choose from. If you've already done it and it doesn't need to be done again, it will be greyed out, therefore making it easy for you to keep track of how often you do things that don't need to be done as often. Genius!

I got the idea to make this based on the episode of the Office where Pam tries to make a chore wheel, but no one likes it cause it doesn't spin. I thought, that seems like just enough fun to make horrible, boring, awful chores (yes, I'm an adult...) more bearable and fun to do. Possibly, I could add in the tiny wheel to pick between the smaller, more specific categories for an added Office cameo. I also feel like there is some potential to add bonuses and streaks and all sorts of things. Though, not quite sure what the bonuses would be yet. The point is to make undesireable tasks more fun, like a game.

## Features
- **THE WHEEL**: The most basic feature of the site, this wheel will be instantly spinnable without logging in, so, therefore, it will be the first thing you see. As well as the main feature of the site. I've decided I'd like to make it in JavaScript, thus giving me a major new thing to make. I'll have to figure out exactly how first, but that's certainly part of the fun.
- **USER ACCOUNTS**: Each account will have a unique name and password, an ability to keep your account logged in always (since most of the time you'll probably just be accessing this chore wheel at home or on your own phone), as well as a group of custom "rooms" (or areas of focus) which then have a smaller break down of tasks.
- **SPECIFIC USER TASK LISTS**: Each account will have it's own custom wheel based on the categories / rooms / areas of focus that that specific user has imputted into the app. Each room has an option of having a "tiny wheel" of specific chores broken down. This will also be where we keep track of the last date it was done and how frequent this specific chore should be done, thus automatically making it not an option if you just did it yesterday. I also think it'd be cool to just have a to-do list break down as well.

## What I'll Have to Learn
I will need to learn at least the basics of Javascript. Maybe even more. Since this is something I'd already like to do, this project would be a great way to jump right in and do so. I'm sure there are other things I'll need to learn, such as cookies and logging in stuff (I haven't done that with Java yet, just with Python and Flask...), and other things will be discovered along the way.
